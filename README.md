**Project 1** 

**Description:** The goal of the project was to create an information system for a chain of farmacies using the knowledge of algorithms and data structures gathered throughout the course. The system was to be created as a console application with CRUD operations and sorting/listing operations. We had the constraint of using only linear data structures (lists, arrays,...). A detailed report on the project can be found in `docs/report_project_1.pdf` (it's written in portuguese though). The detailed specification can be found in `docs/specification_project_1.pdf`.

**Technologies:** C++, STL

**Grade:** *19.4/20*

**Project 2** 

**Description:** This project was built on top of the first one and the goal was to alter the first solution to use non-linear data-structures (sets, trees,...). A detailed report on the project can be found in `docs/report_project_2.pdf` (it's written in portuguese though). The detailed specification can be found in `docs/specification_project_2.pdf`.

**Technologies:** C++, STL

**Grade:** *19.6/20*
